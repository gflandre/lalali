This is lalali, an iPhone app I made on December 2010.

Here's the iTunes description:

lalali is an easy-to-use translation app for your iPhone that lets you remember the words you translated.

Ever wanted to store somewhere all these new words you come across while reading a French book in the park for example?
lalali lets you do just that.

lalali:
 - Translates any word or sentence using the powerful Google Translate engine.
 - Automatically stores every word you translate and displays it in a list.
 - Lets you mark a translation so you can easily find it later. It's convenient if you have trouble remembering a particular word for example.
 - Lets you only display your marked words* Lets you hide one part of the translation as a learning exercise
 - Lets you hide the entire "to" or "from" column of the list the same way
 - Lets you remove translations off the listThe following languages are available: Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Basque, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Maltese, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Welsh, Yiddish
